# Configuration Examples

This section provides example configurations for Groups and Nodes in various scenarios.

## Available Examples

### Development Examples
- [K3D Group Example](k3d-group.md) - Basic autoscaling group for k3d development
- [K3D Node Example](k3d-node.md) - Simulated physical node for k3d testing

### Production Examples
- [Production Examples](production-examples.md) - Real-world configurations with various power management methods

## Quick Start

For a quick start with k3d development environment, begin with the [K3D Group Example](k3d-group.md) and [K3D Node Example](k3d-node.md).

For production deployments, review the [Production Examples](production-examples.md) which demonstrate:
- Wake-on-LAN power management
- IPMI-based control
- Smart PDU integration
- GPU worker configurations
